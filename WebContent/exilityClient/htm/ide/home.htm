    <p>
    <br />
    This is the first-cut version of an environment to develop Exility based Applications.
    <br />
    This is a work-in-progress. As of now you should be using Generate Page, Generate DataTypes and Generate Labels under Admin menu.
    <br />
    You may take a curious look at other pages, but do not save any of them, unless you do not have enough trouble with your work already.
    </p>

    <br /><br /><p>This version DOES NOT require you to choose project etc.. It works with your application always.</p>

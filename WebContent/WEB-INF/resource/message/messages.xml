	file in which you organize messages that are to be displayed to end user.
	We strongly recommend that the messages are added in sorted order by name, so that it is easy for any one to avoid duplicates.
	If you are likely to have hundreds of messages, then you are better-off having one file per module and using a module-prefix to message name. 

	Exility standard messages are found in WEB-INF/exilityResource/message/messages.xml. These names should not be re-used.
